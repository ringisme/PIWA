# Update Logs

## 5.1

- Reconstruct the app frame to extend its compatibility with the different datasets.
- Add visitor mode to let the app can be executed on sample data.
- Add interface descriptions by using Markdown documents.
- Bug fixes.



## 3.22

- Updated the "README.md". Please read it if you cannot run the app because of "wrong path".
- Removed the "comma" existed in the displayed years.
- Fixed the bug that the filtered table cannot be downloaded before.
- The list of variables in the select box can be automatically formed now, so the name of the displayed variable can vary with the input data resources.
- Revised the application structure to separated frame now. All the pre-loaded functions and variables have been settled in an isolated file, so that the loading and reacting time of the application will be shorter than before.



## 1.25

- Changed UI designing package from "shiny" to "shinyBoard". Now it has a brand new UI having better performance.

- Instead of "submitButton" with "actionButton". Now the "Submit" button can control separated functions.
