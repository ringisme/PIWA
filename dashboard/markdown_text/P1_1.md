> This page is to display the trend overview of the selected variable (or indicator) in the period around the "current date".

- The upper two plots shows the trend of the selected variable in the period around the "current day". The different blue-colored layers in background represent the different levels of the indicator based on its recorded values. More deep color means it has lower value compared with the historical values. 

  The levels follow the sequence of `Low (< 0%), Moderately low (0% ~ 10%), Slightly low (10% ~ 25%), Normal (25% ~ 75%), Slightly high (75% ~ 90%), Moderately high (90% ~ 100%), and High (> 100%)`. The percentages in parentheses represent the intervals based on the percentiles of the recorded data. For example, a value on *Aug. 15 1990* with the level "Slightly low" means this value is higher than 10% but lower than 25% of the values on *Aug. 15* of all recorded years.

  - For the plot of Historical Period (the upper left one): Each dot represents the **real value** of the indicator on this day.
  - For the plot of Future Period (the upper right one): Each dot represents the **average value** of the indicator on the days of all recorded years.

- For the plot in the lower left side: Each dot represents the **real value** of fire event on this day.

- You can move the cursor on these dots to get the detailed information.
